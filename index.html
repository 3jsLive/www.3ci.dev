		</h1>

		<p>The story so far: A watcher service polls the <b>GitHub API</b> looking for commits to the repository or open pull
			requests.
			Should a push event be detected, it gets split into its individual commits (if necessary) and re-pushed
			to a fork. This triggers a build pipeline on Microsoft's <b>Azure cloud</b>, resulting in two builds - one
			unmodified and one with source maps inlined.<br />
			While the unmodified one is used for regular <i>syntax/code checks</i> and <i>linters</i>, the
			<i>type search</i> and <i>dependency management</i> modules need the additional location data supplied by
			source maps.<br />
			The <i>dependency tree</i> gained from running the examples in a headless browser, crossed with a commit's
			diff, and more (simpler) heuristics ought to reduce run times while also minimizing storage space (very WIP).<br />
			Tests and checks are executed mostly in parallel, thanks to Azure's free 10 hosted workers.
			Given GitHub's recent public opening of <b>GitHub Actions</b>, with its even more generous 20 free workers,
			there might be a rewrite waiting for us in the future.<br />
			<b>Stack:</b> <b>JavaScript</b> with small bits of <b>Bash</b>, databases all <b>SQLite</b>,
			and workers by the aforementioned <b>Azure</b> and 3rd party servers. Formerly a (IMO glorious) mess
			of microservices, now much less so and soon to be replaced with Docker. <b>VueJS</b> for the frontend.

					The official <a href="https://threejs.org/examples/"><code>three.js</code> examples</a> don't
					reference the actual individual
					source files in the core library, but rather include the transpiled & bundled version that - for now
					- still needs manual updating and committing. <i>live</i> rebuilds the library artifacts for
					every commit (<code>dev</code> branch & PRs) for easier testing.<br />
					Todo: Efficient paging, it's getting <i>slightly</i> out of hand

					Currently runs various checks, linters, a frankly excessive <i>type search</i> and file-level
					dependency management. Lots of flaky tests that are highly tuned to the file- and code structure
					of the library. Fun.<br />
					Next: Increase dependencies tracking to function-level, then reduce runtime by only retesting
					modified functions.<br />And cleanup the frontend code, it could use a proper brushing.<br />
					Soon: Visual regression tests with Chrome's frame-precision render control,
					automated profiling(alpha) and automated performance alerts<br />
					Future: Given time and money, a fixed set of bare metal servers for more consistent measurements, maybe?
